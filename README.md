This is an individual assignment from Processamento de Dados Massivos em Nuvem course at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG). To this practical work, the students were deliberately oriented to write separate documentation instead of developing Jupyter Notebooks in a storytelling fashion.

This practical work was developed based on a dataset built by UFMG students over Twitter posts. The dataset was already given to the course us to perform this assignment and I was able to explore whichever topics I wanted, however, it was necessary to answer the two basic questions described in the documentation.

You are allowed to do whatever you want with the files from this repository.
